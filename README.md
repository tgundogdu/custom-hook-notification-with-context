# Custom Notification Hook With Context API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can see the demo on the [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/custom-notify-hook-with-context-api-5v5kg2)

In this repo I made notification send globally. You can access from any child component and send notification with parameters.

I hope you like it :)
